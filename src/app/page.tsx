          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            We as humans are emotional creatures.  Our emotional system is complex and wonderful.  It is one of our defining characteristics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Food, music, film, books, social media, religion, politics, marketing, medicine, engineering, news media, software, law, love, and our very survival are underscored by emotional decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this makes some sense.  We do not usually have the time to perform an in-depth study or track down peer-reviewed research before we need to take action.  We can usually rely on our instincts to move us in the right direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            While our instincts serve us well, the right mix of inputs can manipulate us to form irrational or negative opinions about the world around us.  They can even get us to make choices that oppose our own best interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, we have data at our disposal that can help fill some of the gaps in our instinctual decision-making.
